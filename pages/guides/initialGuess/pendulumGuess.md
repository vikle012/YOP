## What we want to achieve
{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepWInit3.gif" alt="sidestepWInit3" caption="Optimal solution for sidestepping inverted pendulum." %}

## What we get if we don't have a initial guess
{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepWOInit.gif" alt="sidestepWOInit" caption="Suboptimal solution for sidestepping inverted pendulum." %}

## What we get if we have a bad initial guess
{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepInit2.gif" alt="sidestepInit2" caption="Bad initial guess" %}

{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepWInit2.gif" alt="sidestepWInit2" caption="Sidestep with a bad initial guess." %}

## How a good initial guess could look like
{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepInit3.gif" alt="sidestepInit3" caption="Good initial guess" %}

{% include image.html file="example_images/pendulumSidestep/sidestepWInit2.gif" alt="sidestepWInit3" caption="Sidestep with a good initial guess" %}
